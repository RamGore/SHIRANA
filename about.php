                            We believe that everyone has rights to live his life without stress and difficulties our first responsibility is to our society the people living surrounding us. If they are in distress society cannot be stable or peaceful to maintain this balance we must strengthen to weaker people of society the people living with POVERTY in society need to fulfill their needs so economically they should be self-supported.
                            Our second responsibility is to the communities in which we live. We must be a good citizen-support good work and charity, and bear our fair share of taxes. We must maintain in good order the property we are privileged to.

                            Vocational training is training for a specific career or trade, excluding the professions.
                            Vocational training focuses on practical applications of skills learned, and is generally unconcerned with theory or traditional academic skills. A large part of the education in vocational schools is hands-on training. Vocational training thus provides a link between education and the working world. It is usually provided either at the high school level or in a postsecondary trade school.<br>

However, distressed people are normally considered a financial burden and, due to poverty, no special provision is provided for them. There are many examples of girls being left at home, alone all day while their parents, brothers and sisters work in the fields. Now at the age of 15 to 35 they are too old to begin. Therefore in addition to teaching art and craft they also need to be taught basic number skills, computer skills, reading, and writing.
